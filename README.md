This was a group project that I completed for my capstone.
I took on the responibilty of deveoloping the backend of the project.
I created the database and connected the project to the database
I then created the logic to connect the data from the database to the HTML ListView Element in the Home Page and the Listing page that shows the users listings.
I than developed the HTML for the CreateListing Page and connected it to the database so that we could store data.
The HTML for the Profile Page was developed by GIT user ADJGi7.
The HTML for the Item page was done in colaboration by Git Users EpicBz and ADJGi7.
Git User frankswesley91 was responibile for the CSS and the large majority of the HTML including the Create Account page, the Login Page and all HTML on the Home page not related to the ListView Element.
